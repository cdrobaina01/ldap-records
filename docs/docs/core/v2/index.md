# Overview

LdapRecord is a PHP package that provides you with a full ActiveRecord
implementation for working with your LDAP server. Each LDAP object type
has a corresponding "Model" which is used to interact with that type.
An LDAP object type is determined by its object classes.

Models allow you to execute search operations on your LDAP server as well as create and modify objects.

PHP applications that require LDAP integration are very tricky to setup. Creating these
integrations yourself can take days or even weeks due to the amount of learning
you must take on to understand how LDAP works.

LdapRecord sweats the small stuff so you can get up and running as fast as possible.

If you require support or assistance getting set up, consider becoming a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/stevebauman)
to receive issue priority so you get up and running as fast as possible.
