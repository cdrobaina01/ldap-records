# Overview

LdapRecord-Laravel is a package providing you the ability to search
your LDAP directory, perform operations, and authenticate
LDAP users into your Laravel application.

It uses the core [LdapRecord](/docs/core/v3) package under the hood, so be sure to look at its
[documentation](/docs/core/v3), so you have an understanding of how everything works.
It was created with the mindset of porting Laravel's fantastic Eloquent
database ORM to an LDAP equivalent.

If you ever encounter issues or simply need some help getting up and running,
